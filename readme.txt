SUPERMILAGE DISPLAY

SYNOPSIS:
	This is a GUI application built using the JUCE C++ library (https://juce.com)
to serve as a data display for both the Supermilage Car as well as the ground crew for
Cedarville University's Supermilage competition team.

BUILD INSTRUCTIONS:
	JUCE projects are built using the Projucer, an application used to export
JUCE project files into a build system (Visual Studio, Makefile, XCode, etc.).
As of right now, only the source code is tracked in git (this may change in the
future; if so, this text should likewise change). So, to build, I would
recommend making a Projucer project on your local machine with the source files
contained in this repo (see src/ directory) and exporting to your build system
of choice. DO NOT upload an exported Projucer project to this repo -- I'm
warning you right now, they're massive (upwards of 1 GB)!
